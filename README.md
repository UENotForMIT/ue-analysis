# ue-analysis

## Rohan Kadambi (3rd Year PhD Candidate in Chemical Engineering)

This repository was created as a response to the current effort of the MIT GSU to join the UE. It does not intend to argue for or against such an action but rather to answer numerical questions surrounding this potential partnership. The entirety of this analysis is contained in `/nb/base-analysis.ipynb`. Most of the data used in this analysis come directly from the US Department of Labor and can be independently obtained [here](https://olmsapps.dol.gov/olpdr/). To simplify executing the code provide, the relevant reports have been cached and saved in the `/data` directory. This directory also contains a modern copy of the UE national constitution which is referenced several times. 

Contributing to this work is highly encouraged. Here I interpret contributing to include correction of existing errors, an expansion of scope, or changes to existing analyses to make them more objective.

I encourage visitors to this repository to review `/nb/base-analysis.ipynb` as this file will preview in your browser with both a summary of results and some elucidating graphs.
